## Description:
The app functionality and front end were provided as part of UW Madison Extended Web Development Bootcamp. The scope of the project was adding offline functionality and deploying to heroku. 



## Technologies
The Express.js framework was used for the API. The MongoDB ORM was used to ease the communication between the javascript app logic and the Mongoose database querying. IndexedDB was used to provide cahcing for offline functinoality. The application is deployed on heroku. MongoDB Atlas was used to allow MongoDB usage with heroku. A web manifest was added 
to let users’ devices know what they’re installing and how the app should look on the home screen.


## Deployment:
The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://dry-shore-08980.herokuapp.com/)




## Usage
A user can simply type in the amount of money they would like to add or subtract in order to track their spending.
